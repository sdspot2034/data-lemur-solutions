# 3-Topping Pizzas [McKinsey SQL Interview Question]

> Problem info:
> Difficulty: `Hard`
> Company: `McKinsey`

You’re a consultant for a major pizza chain that will be running a promotion where all 3-topping pizzas will be sold for a fixed price, and are trying to understand the costs involved.

Given a list of pizza toppings, consider all the possible 3-topping pizzas, and print out the total cost of those 3 toppings. Sort the results with the highest total cost on the top followed by pizza toppings in ascending order.

==Break ties by listing the ingredients in alphabetical order, starting from the first ingredient, followed by the second and third.==

*P.S. Be careful with the spacing (or lack of) between each ingredient. Refer to our Example Output.*

Notes:
- Do not display pizzas where a topping is repeated. For example, ‘Pepperoni,Pepperoni,Onion Pizza’.
- Ingredients must be listed in alphabetical order. For example, 'Chicken,Onions,Sausage'. 'Onion,Sausage,Chicken' is not acceptable.

## `pizza_toppings` Table:

| Column Name | Type |
| --- | --- |
| topping_name | varchar(255) |
| ingredient_cost | decimal(10,2) |

### `pizza_toppings` Example Input:

| topping_name | ingredient_cost |
| --- | --- |
| Pepperoni | 0.50 |
| Sausage | 0.70 |
| Chicken | 0.55 |
| Extra Cheese | 0.40 |

## Example Output:

| pizza | total_cost |
| --- | --- |
| Chicken,Pepperoni,Sausage | 1.75 |
| Chicken,Extra Cheese,Sausage | 1.65 |
| Extra Cheese,Pepperoni,Sausage | 1.60 |
| Chicken,Extra Cheese,Pepperoni | 1.45 |

### Explanation

There are four different combinations of the three toppings. Cost of the pizza with toppings Chicken, Pepperoni and Sausage is $0.55 + $0.50 + $0.70 = $1.75.

Additionally, they are arranged alphabetically; in the dictionary, the chicken comes before pepperoni and pepperoni comes before sausage.
